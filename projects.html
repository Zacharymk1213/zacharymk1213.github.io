        <h1>Contributions to Open-Source Projects</h1>
		<h2>SRT Grammar to Antlr4 Grammars repo</h2>
			<a href="https://github.com/antlr/grammars-v4/pull/4567"> Link to the PR </a>
			<p>This is my first grammar accepted into the Antlr4 Grammars repository. This repository is a collection of grammars for all manner of data formats and programming langauges that can be integrated into projects that use ANTLR, a parser generator library. My contribution met the high quality standards of this repository and is now the standard for defining the SRT captioning format in ANTLR.</p>
		<h2> Contributing the Windows Pipeline to Gnome Text Editor </h2>
			<a href="https://gitlab.gnome.org/GNOME/gnome-text-editor/-/commit/adfd7d70c98df2f56822994e618e37dd4a6bf97c"> Example commit among others for creating and maintaining this pipeline </a>
			<p> I created the Windows pipeline for Gnome Text Editor demonstrating my CI/CD skills. This pipeline enabled previously impossible builds for Windows. </p>
	<h1> Open-source transpilers </h1>
		<h2> Dar.js </h2>
			<a href="https://gitlab.com/pninim/dar/dar.js"> Repository </a>
			<p> Interned at the <a href="https://pninim.org/en/">Pninim</a> text digitization project and created a transpiler for their DSL which translates to HTML by modifying Djot.js. This transpiler is used daily by their editors as part of their digitization workflow. </p>
		<h2> DarANTLR </h2>
			<a href="https://gitlab.com/ZacharyKleiman/darantlr"> Repository </a>
			<p> The intended replacement for Dar.js. This is a complete rewrite of dar.js rewriting it to be implemented it from scratch using a custom grammar using the ANTLR parser generator library. This rewrite enables more maintainable code and more comprehensive coverage of the Dar standard. </p>
	<h1> Websites developed </h1>
	<ol>
		<li><a href="https://www.rabbimayerschiller.com">rabbimayerschiller.com</a>: A web app created for the public intellectual Rabbi Mayer Schiller showcasing all his work and gathering it in a publicly accessible archive. This site also includes an admin dashboard to manage all content on the site. The website is implemented using a Spring Boot backend with the Thymeleaf templating engine and a Postgres database. </li>
		<li><a href="https://www.timrosen.com">timrosen.com</a>: A CMS developed for use by Prof. Tim Rosen of Queens College. This site includes his blog, articles and books with a dashboard for him to manage content. This site was created in Express using the EJS templating engine and uses Sqlite3. Obviously, any opinions on his site are purely his own and he speaks for no one but himself. </li>
		<li><a href="https://therootuser.dev">therootuser.dev</a>: My own tech blog and site. This is developed as a static website hosted on Github pages. The static site workflow was inspired by one of my favorite tech blogs, <a href="https://www.unixdigest.com">unixdigest</a>.</li>

	<h1> Desktop utilities developed </h1>
	<ol>
		<li> File Searcher: Developed as part of my job at Community Board 7 this Python app allows searching the text of word files in bulk to sort poorly named files thereby saving countless man-hours. Mike, the Community Board’s IT guy was impressed by it and encouraged me to further develop it for use throughout the community boards. </li>
		<li>Burns Depression Index Tracker: A Desktop app created in Python for a friend who struggles with depression and regardly uses the Burns Depression index. I realized there was no app to track scores on this so I created an app for a recognized gap. It enables the user to calculate their score on the Burns Depression Index. It also saves scores over time (down to the second) in a SQLite database allowing for viewing one’s scores over time. This would be useful to monitor depression severity. It can also show a graph for a user-specified period to see how one’s scores have fluctuated. <a href="https://github.com/Zacharymk1213/burns-depression-index"> Link </a> </li>
		<li> Connections: Desktop app created in Python that allows people to make tables for variousconnections they have and list relevant contact information for them. This allows people to log their social circle and network more efficiently. Created due to a need to sort my network. <a href="https://github.com/Zacharymk1213/Connections"> Link </a>
