        <h1>The Needs of this Website</h1>
<p>This website serves the purpose of allowing me to make my mark on the modern web. It does not need to be updated save when I add a new blog post or want to add a new section to the site. Also, the only person editing it will be yours truly so a developer-only workflow is perfectly fine for my purposes as long as it isn't tedious and annoying. This left me with the following options:</p>
<ol>
<li>Create a fancy app in some framework like React with a complicated server backend in eg. Spring or Django.</li>
<li>Create a complicated server backend and have it use templates to get information from a database and render things.</li>
<li>Use a no or low code platform like Wix or even Substack to create a blog or website.</li>
<li>Use a static site generator like eleventy and make most of my site in markdown and raw HTML and just do a git pull on the server to update things and do git push on my machine to push the updates.</li>
</ol>
<p>I have far too much professional pride to do 3 and 1 and 2 are just massively overengineered solutions for my needs. Therefore I decided to go with 4 especially since I'm rather proficient in HTML and Markdown. The design of this site was inspired by one of my favorite tech blogs <a href="www.unixdigest.com">unixdigest</a> and I tried to keep it very simple and beautiful like his site instead of going for fancy and it enables a certain retro feel that I like.</p>
